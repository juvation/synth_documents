I stumble across something that really rocks my world, and, if I feel
that it's something I can build, I tend to drop everything and go for
it. I've experienced that with the Buchla 291 Bandpass Filter, the Korg
PS Resonator (when I heard Jeff Pontius' use of it with his MAM RS3),
and with the Boss Dimension C. <br> <br>My first exposure to the
Dimension C came from the Synth DIY list. The conversation was about
the MN3207/MN3102 BBD chipset, and someone queried about what chorus
units used those chips. The Dimension C was brought up, and a link to
samples at Modezero was posted.</font></p><p><a href="http://www.modezero.com/boss_dimension_c.htm" target="_self" name="" title=""><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana" size="3">Mode Zero Dimension C Sound Samples</font></a></p><p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana" size="3">I
listened to them and, well, Holy Moly! That was the sound I'd hear in
my head when I thought 'Chorus'. This sound was probably planted there
from hearing the Dimension C's big brother, the Roland Dimension D, but
it was close enough that I knew I had to try it. <br> <br>What are the
Dimensions D and C? They're a type of Chorus pioneered by Roland to
give a 'motionless' chorus effect. The effect is less intense than,
say, an ensemble chorus made up of three delay lines modulated by a
pair of triphase LFO's. In fact, the original Dimension devices were,
in some modes, more along the lines of a *subliminal* effect than an
outright 'in-your-face' type of effect. You could forget you were
actually using the device until you bypassed it. <br> <br>The
Dimension effects use two delay lines as opposed to the three delay
lines mentioned above in the ensemble chorus. The delay lines are
modulated antiphase to each other by an internal LFO to defeat the
perceived rhythmical cycle of the LFO that is common with single delay
chorus devices. The end result is a feeling of depth without motion. <br> <br>The
Dimensions C and D had four modes of operation, selectable from four
switches. The modes started from barely perceivable effect (mode 1)
through a more intense effect (mode 4). <br> <br>The Roland Dimension
D was a rack-mount unit that had balanced and unbalanced stereo inputs
and was capable of processing studio level signals. It utilized the
MN3007/MN3101 chipset. <br> <br>The Boss Dimension C DC-2 was a stompbox that had a single mono unbalanced input, and either a mono or stereo output. <br> <br>Each
device utilized a pair of NE570 companders to render an amazingly quiet
performance from the two BBD's. Moreover, the devices use a
sophisticated method of equalization to arrive at the crystaline sound
that they produce.</font></p><p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana" size="3">Below is a link to the functional block diagram of the original Boss Dimension C.</font></p><p><a href="http://mypeoplepc.com/members/scottnoanh/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/dimc_block1.jpg">Dimension C Block Diagram</a><!--"''"--></p><p></p><div align="center"><img alt="Dim C/TZF Logo" src="Dim%20C%20-%20TZF_files/dimc_logo.jpeg" align="" border="" width="240"></div><p></p><p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana" size="4"><b>From DC-2 Dimension C to Dim C/TZF</b></font></p><p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana" size="3">This

Pontius, who designed the panel pictured above, and I decided early on
to build a rack mount version of the Dimension C. Having the space of a
rack mount panel, thoughts began turning to "what else can this thing
do?". The original Dimensions had little more than a bypass switch and
the four mode switches. <br> <br>First off, I began exploring the
differences between the Dimension C and Dimension D. One obvious
difference is that the Dimension D can process stereo input signals.
Soon, it became obvious that all the points were present in the
Dimension C to allow the same functionality. The Dimension C even had
an unused half of an NE570 that could be used as the compressor for the
added channel! So, that's exactly what I did. <br> <br>Below is a link to the block diagram of the Dimension C with stereo input.</font></p><p><a href="http://mypeoplepc.com/members/scottnoanh/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/dimc_block3.jpg">Dim C Modified for Stereo Input</a><!--"''"--></p><p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana" size="3">A
fantastic function shared between the two Dimension devices is the
ability to accept a mono signal and render it wonderfully in stereo. I
retained this function with the Dim C/TZF by using a switching jack for
the 'Right' input. With no plug inserted into this jack, it routes the
mono input down the 'stereo' path for mono to stereo conversion. This
also preserves the mono output function of the original Dimension C (I
do not believe the Dimension D had this function, BTW). <br> <br>Below is a link to the block diagram of the Dim C in mono operation, with the added stereo input circuitry in place.</font></p><p><a href="http://mypeoplepc.com/members/scottnoanh/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/dimc_block4.jpg">Dim C Stereo Input in Mono Input Operation</a><!--"''"--></p><p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana" size="3">In
order to better handle the output impedance and levels of the synth, I
added input buffers consisting of NE5532's. I also have added an input
attenuator consisting of a dual ganged 100K linear pot. Below are links
to the schematics for both the input buffer and stereo input.</font></p><p><a href="http://mypeoplepc.com/members/scottnoanh/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/dimc_inputbuffer.jpg">Dim C/TZF Signal Input Buffer</a><!--"''"--></p><p><a href="http://mypeoplepc.com/members/scottnoanh/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/dimc_stereo_input.jpg">Dim C/TZF Stereo Input Channel</a><!--"''"--></p><p><a href="http://mypeoplepc.com/members/scottnoanh/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/dimc_stereoin_con.jpg">Stereo (Right) Input Channel Connection to Original Circuit</a><!--"''"--></p><p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana" size="3"><b>Mode and Internal LFO Control</b></font></p><p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana" size="3">Next
up were the operating modes themselves. The Dimension C Mode switches
are DPDT. One pole places a resistance in parallel with the timing
resistor of the LFO to alter the frequency of the LFO, and the other
pole places a resistance in parallel with the output resistor of the
LFO in order to affect the depth of modulation. My hat is off to the
Roland/Boss engineers - they certainly found the prime sweet spots of
the devices. <br> <br>But, still, there does exist a spectrum of
effect between these modes. This was easily provided for by putting in
pots in parallel with the above mentioned resistors. But - a few of the
modes actually *open* the parallel resistances, and a pot will not
quite get there, so the solution to this was to have three of the
original mode switches (more on that in a bit), plus an additional
switch that selected the mode switches or the pots for control of LFO
frequency and depth. <br> <br>What is it with only three mode switches
when the original Dimension C had four modes of operation? Quite simply
it's this: the original Mode 1 switch switched *nothing* - it was there
so that both the frequency and depth resistors could have infinite
resistance placed in parallel with them with the switch assembly used
by Boss. Because I am not constricted to a single switch assembly
(we're going to use toggle switches), putting in a switch to switch
nothing obviously would have been useless. So, the way it works is that
with all three of the mode switches in the 'off' position, *that* is
Mode 1. With mode switch one only in the on position, that is Mode 2.
With mode switch two only in the on position, that is Mode 3, and with
mode switch three only in the on position, that is Mode 4. Note that,
unlike the original Dimension C, different mode switches can be on at
the same time, giving a bit more variation with mode switch operation. <br> <br>The
fourth switch is a switch that disconnects the effect of the three mode
switches and applies the settings of the frequency and depth pots. When
this switch is applied, only the frequency and depth pots will affect
the Dim C/TZF operation. One use for this could be the setting of a
'custom' mode that could be accessed with the flick of a switch. This
configuration not only preserves the original functionality of the
Dimension C mode selection, but expands upon it.</font></p><p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana" size="3">Another
switch was added to provide more range to the LFO settings. Increasing
the LFO rate beyond the original function provided very, well, strange
effects. Lowering the frequency, however, brought a whole new dimension
to the sound - a very nice, smooth effect indeed. It's still possible,
with this implementation of the Dimension C to get those bizarre
effects, but that is mentioned later. Right now, the switch being
discussed provides two additional ranges of frequency below the
original LFO range.</font></p><p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana" size="3">Below
is the link to the schematic on how the mode selection, pot control of
depth and frequency, and LFO frequency range functions were implemented.</font></p><p><a href="http://mypeoplepc.com/members/scottnoanh/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/dimc_lfocontrol.jpg">Dim C Mode Selection and LFO Control</a><!--"''"--></p><p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana" size="3">The
switch used to select between the mode switch and pot operation is a
standard two position DPDT switch. The switch used for selection of the
LFO frequency range is actually a three position C&amp;K 7211 DPDT
switch. A detail of how it works is shown at the following link.</font></p><p><a href="http://mypeoplepc.com/members/scottnoanh/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/dimc_lfofreq_detail.jpg">Dim C LFO Frequency Selection Switch Detail</a><!--"''"--></p><p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana" size="3"><b>Manual and External Voltage Control of Delay Time</b></font></p><p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana" size="3">The
next step was to add some 'modular' power to the Dim C/TZF - voltage
control of the delay time itself. This provides a means of overcoming
any limitation of LFO frequency or LFO waveform, so, for one thing,
those 'crazy' sounds mentioned before are certainly accessible. But,
aside from weird sounds, I've found that voltage control of the delay
times also adds a whole spectrum of effect - especially when one
considers synchronization with other functions, or applying voltage
control other than an LFO to the device. Envelope generators, for
example, reveal a whole new side when controlling the delay time. VCO's
provide audio rate modulation of the delay, which is a much more 'in
your face' effect than the Dimension C was ever envisioned to be. Even
when using an LFO, you have a choice of the waveform that is used to
modulate the delay time of the Dim C/TZF. <br> <br>To be useful,
implementing CV obviously required an input attenuator for the voltage
input, and I was struck with the idea of providing a dual use for that
pot - with no CV applied to the Dim C, this pot could be used as a
manual control to set the delay times to a static setting. <br> <br>What
use would this provide? During my earlier experiments with BBD based
comb filters, I found that a static setting of the delay time could
render different tonalities, or 'resonances' to a signal - rather like
an unusual filter bank or like setting a static phase using a phase
shifter. <br> <br>Another thing that spurred this thought was the TZF
output, and a conversation of symmetrical versus asymmetrical
modulation of the flange effect that occured on the DIY stompbox list.
The thought was that if one only modulated one of the delay lines, then
the perceived through-zero effect could be set to occur at any point of
the sweep of the moving delay. Actually, I had a basic misunderstanding
about how this would work, or what Mark Hammer and Mike Irwin were
getting at. The through-zero point could still be adjusted to occur at
the 'end' of the sweep or closer to the middle still with both delays
being modulated, but Mark's point was that coming up with an LFO wave
with the proper hypertriangular shape would present some challenges to
the concept. In any event, my experimentation did result in getting
quite a variety of different sweep effects by sweeping only one of the
delays. That, and the perceived sweep of the delay was longer because
only one of the delays was moving. <br> <br>From this line of thought,
an additional control was added - a switch that performs three
functions. In position 1, the switch allows control of both delay lines
by the internal LFO. In position 2, the switch allows control of one of
the delay lines by either the applied control voltage or to be set at a
fixed delay if no control voltage is applied. The other delay is still
swept by the internal LFO in this position. In position 3, both of the
delay lines are controlled antiphase to each other by either the
applied CV, or if no CV is applied, their delay time is set by the CV
attenuator/manual control. Being that the control acts on the delays in
antiphase, moving this control has the effect of spreading the delay
times in relation to each other. <br> <br>If I would have had + and -
voltage supplies available to me, it would have been very easy and
quick to accomplish this, but because the Dim C internally runs off of
+9V and ground, this presented a learning curve to me - I'd never
really dealt with unipolar synth circuits before! Eventually I came
across a design that works quite satifactorily for the application,
though it may seem a bit odd to the more experienced.</font></p><p><a href="http://mypeoplepc.com/members/scottnoanh/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/dimc_cvmanual.jpg">External CV/Manual Control Circuit Schematic</a><!--"''"--></p><p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana" size="3">For
the manual control, I connect 9V to the normal input of the CV input
jack through a 1K protection resistor. This is applied through the
External CV/Manual Control pot to the base of Q501. The CV input jack
is a stereo jack, so when a plug is inserted into it, two things
happen: the signal on the plug is applied to the base of Q501 and the
base of Q502 is grounded, causing comparator U501A to rail positive,
which applies an offset to the base of Q501, allowing bipolar CV's to
control the frequency of the BBD clocks.</font></p><p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana" size="3">Following is the schematic for the CV/Manual switch and the interconnect into the main Dimension C circuit.</font></p><p><a href="http://mypeoplepc.com/members/scottnoanh/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/dimc_cvswitchdetail.jpg">CV Select Switch and Circuit Interconnect</a><!--"''"--></p><p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana" size="3"><b>TZF: Through-Zero Flanging</b></font></p><p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana" size="3">To
begin with, a quick note on what Through Zero Flanging (TZF) is.
Flanging was born as a studio trick and can be heard on any number of
popular songs - The Doobie Brothers' "Listen to the Music" or the
Eagles "Life in the Fast Lane" are a couple that come to mind, along
with the Small Faces classic "Itchy Koo Park". The technique involves
putting two copies of the same track on two different tape machines,
and mixing them together onto a third tape machine. Varying the play
speed of one or both of the tape machines resulted in the swooshing
sound that is flanging. The word flanging itself refers to the practice
of slowing one of the reels down by placing a thumb against the flange
of the reel. <br> <br>TZF refers to the technique of one of the reels
going faster or slower than the other reel, so that the material on
that tape occurs slightly before and after the material on the other
tape. When the two tapes are exactly in sync, no effect is heard, but
as material on one tape approaches then passes the other tape in time,
the intense jet plane swoosh can be heard swooshing 'in' then swooshing
'out', with the zero point unaffected, and appearing more or less 'in
the middle' of the effect. <br> <br>Using BBD's for TZF has always
been a bit problematic. To achieve TZF, one BBD has to delay the
original signal so that the other BBD can move 'before' and 'after' the
delayed signal in time. This implies that the clocks of the BBD's must
'cross' each other. This normally results in annoying heterodyning
between the clocks. <br> <br>Having said, that multi-BBD chorus
effects all have TZF built into them - the BBD's are constantly
crossing themselves in time. When I first looked at the Dimension C
schematic, I realized that somewhere in there, TZF was occuring, and
had all of these complicated ideas about how to extract it. It was Mike
Irwin who found a simple, yet effective method of getting a TZF
response out of it. He found that passively mixing the outputs of the
expander together resulted in a satisfying TZF effect. So that's what I
did, and it works wonderfully as an 'extra' output to the Dim C/TZF. <br> <br>Mike's
original idea was to have a trimmer in the passive mixer to maximize
the notch, but I was never able to make it sound any deeper (to my
ears) than two equal value resistors, so I just stuck with that.
Another thing about the TZF output - the two signals have gone through
pre-emphasis tilting them to the treble side of the audio spectrum, and
I originally was going to run the signal through de-emphasis, but I
found the flanging to be more prominent without de-empahasis, so I left
the de-emphasis out. Hence, the TZF output is a 'brighter' output than
the chorus outputs. <br> <br>All kinds of enhancements sprang to mind,
such as positive and negative regeneration, more control of the
individual delay lines, etc, but figured out pretty quickly this extra
control fast outgrew the front panel, so a dedicated TZF module is in
my future. I settled on the one unique 'TZF' output and am quite happy
with it. <br> <br>Below is the schematic to how the TZF output was implemented.</font></p><p><a href="http://mypeoplepc.com/members/scottnoanh/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/dimc_tzfschemo.jpg">TZF Section Schematic</a><!--"''"--></p><p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana" size="3"><b>Effect Bypass Circuit</b></font></p><p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana" size="3">When
I decided to build the Dimension C, I chose to see if I could find as
many of the original parts as possible. This really isn't necessary, as
Mike Irwin has proven that effective substitute parts will work nicely,
but, at the same time, I figured I'd be lucky enough to get the thing
working with the original parts. <br> <br>So, the core of the Dimension C has as many of the original parts that I could find. The exceptions are as follows: <br> <br>For
3V zeners, I used 1N5225's, for 5.1V zeners, I used 1N5231B's, for the
power protect diode, I plan to use a 1N4002, and for the bypass
flipflop, I am using a CD4013 - I could not find a BA634 to save my
life. <br> <br>Debouncing the 4013 proved to be quite a challenge for
me. My test of the switch is actually a foot operated normally open
momentary switch, and a very noisy beast at that for the 'trial by
fire'. After a lot of experimentation, I finally wound up with very
effective de-bouncing. <br> <br>Jeff and I decided to add a bypass
input that would toggle the bypass with a positive trigger pulse rather
than a foot operated switch, making it controllable with modules from
our synthesizers. I added the circuitry to do that, and found that not
only triggers would activate the bypass, but also LFO's and VCO's. This
actually provides an additional means of modulation - modulating the
bypass at audio rate frequencies introduces a sort of AM effect. <br> <br>One
additional comment - I have no idea what color the original 'Check' LED
(LN-28RP) was, but Jeff and I decided to use red as the power LED and
green as the 'active effect' LED, so the original LED has been replaced
with a green LED. <br> <br>Below is the schematic for the Dim C/TZF bypass circuit.</font></p><p><a href="http://mypeoplepc.com/members/scottnoanh/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/dimc_bypass.jpg">Dim C/TZF Bypass Circuit Schematic</a><!--"''"--></p><p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana" size="3"><b>Power Entry and Regulation</b></font></p><p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana" size="3">The
plan is to power the Dim C/TZF with a wall wart supply, most likely a
12V supply. The power entry jack to be used will be a commonly
available 3.5mm connector, and will mount on the outside of the PCB
enclosure. <br> <br>There will be an on-board 9V regulator and
filtering caps to ensure hum-free operation. Until I have had a chance
to try the target wall wart device, I will not have a complete
schematic for that section.</font></p><p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana" size="3"><b>Sound Samples</b></font></p><p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana" size="3">Here's
a multi-tracked sample of processing the modular synth through the Dim
C/TZF using external triangle LFO modulation. At the beginning of the
sample, low frequency noise is processed through the TZF output with an
extremely low modulation. After that, a bit of higher freq noise is
sent along the same path with the Dim C being modulated at a faster
rate. During and after that, mixed in is some ring modulation and
frequency modulation of the VCO's through the filter, through the
normal Dimension C output. All tracks are run through the Dim C, in
Mono In/Mono Out mode. <br> <br>The PT2399 and tank reverb of the Fender Sidekick were used to give some ambience to some of the tracks as well.</font></p><p><a href="http://mypeoplepc.com/members/scottnoanh/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/dimc_extmod.mp3">Dim C/TZF Externally Modulated Processing Modular (1.44 MB)</a><!--"''"--></p><p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana" size="3">Here's a sample of the Dim C modifying the timbre of a modular patch. <br> <br>The
patch consists of the Buchla 291+ filter processing a mix of two
sawtooth VCO's. The VCO's and the filter are being controlled by the
sample and hold circuit from the Buchla 266 Source of Uncertainty
module. The sample and hold is sampling a triangle LFO and is being
clocked by a second pulse wave LFO. The 'normal' sample and hold output
is modulating the bandwidth input of the 291 filter. The two
alternating outputs of the sample and hold are connected to the expo CV
input of each VCO. One of the alternating triggers from the sample and
hold is triggering an AR envelope generator, which is modulating the
frequency input of the 291 filter. The low pass output of the filter is
fed through a VCA, which is also controlled by the envelope generator,
into the Dim C. The Dim C is being modulated by a third triangle LFO.
The pulse wave output of this same LFO is being sent to the FM input of
the filter. The output of the Dim C is going to the recorder. <br> <br>The sample starts out with the Dim C bypassed. At 00:30, the Dim C is unbypassed and remains on until 1:19.</font></p><p><a href="http://mypeoplepc.com/members/scottnoanh/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/291_dimc_e.mp3">Buchla Meets the Dim C (1.7 MB)</a><!--"''"--></p><p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana" size="3">Here

The LFO is quite slow and is modulating the Dim C throughout the full
CV range, so this really would be analagous to Mode 2. This is an
example of the Dim C in its more subtle mode, adding a nice coloration
to the sound. <br> <br>It's just the DW6000 through the Dim C into the recorder, no other effects used. <br> <br>00:00 Starts out in bypassed mode. <br> <br>00:38 Effect is switched on. <br> <br>1:27 the effect is bypassed. <br> <br>1:40 In effect mode again for the short blip at the end.</font></p><p><a href="http://mypeoplepc.com/members/scottnoanh/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/dw600_dimc2.mp3">DimC processing DW6000 (1.65 MB)</a><!--"''"--></p><p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana" size="3">This sample is just some noodling with various patches of the DW6000, using the same patch/settings as above.</font></p><p><a href="http://mypeoplepc.com/members/scottnoanh/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/dw_dimc.mp3">DW6000 through Dim C (5.45 MB)</a><!--"''"--></p><p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana" size="3">Here's
a sample of the Dim C doing two things the original Dimension C did not
do: Processing a stereo input and modulating the delay lines with a
fast pulse. <br> <br>Both left and right outputs of my Korg DW6000 are
patched to the Dim C stereo inputs, and the left and right outputs are
going straight to the recorder (no other effects are used in the
chain). A pulse LFO is patched into the CV input of the Dim C. <br> <br>The
sample starts out with the chorus of the DW6000 off, which is a mono
signal, so the beginning is in mono. At the beginning the Dim C is also
bypassed. At 00:21 I switch the chorus of the DW6000 on, converting it
to a stereo signal. At 00:38, I un-bypass the Dim C. After that, as the
sample progresses, I use the Dim C's CV Level pot to increase the level
of CV for a while, then towards the end I back it off, lowering the
level of CV. The end result is a stereo signal being sharply modulated
in stereo.</font></p><p><a href="http://mypeoplepc.com/members/scottnoanh/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/dimc_dw6k_pulse.mp3">Dim C Stereo In/Out Pulsed Modulation (2 MB)</a><!--"''"--></p><p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana" size="3">Test Sample - Dim C 002.
