Move256.exe Alpha

Win95/98/NT

Used to move Wiard Waveform City waves around in Banks.

Open any TO file (*.256)
Open any FROM file (*.256)

Keeps two open buffers, can be used to rearrange the same file.
Overwrites file with Save so use Save As.

Rev. 1.0

Bugs:

1. Wave and Bank numbers are one off (should start at zero not one).
2. Possible exit errors, don't have any other program (except Move256.exe) open when using
this program. Use at your own risk.
