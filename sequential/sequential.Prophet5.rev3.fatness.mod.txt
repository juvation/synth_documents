This changes the sound of two slightly detuned VCO'sdramatically: You loose the much of the amplitude componentof the beating (no more fading ...), but you still have the thicknessof the detuning. The synth sounds more "brutal", and fatter thanbefore.* This must not be mixed up with filter overdrive. Overdriving  the CEM3320 sounds rather awful, IMO. But if the mixer stage is  clipping, the distortion products are filtered by the VCF.This is how it is done:(1) Increase the gain of the osc mixer amps by factor 3==============================================This is achieved by increasing the amplifier bias currents. -> On PCB3 (Processor board), solder 15k resistors in parallel     to R322 and R328 (both 33k). (best to be done on component     side; you don't even have to remove the board.)     These two resistors affect all 10 mixer VCAs.After this step, you can overdrive the VCF/VCA section. I have notchecked if clipping occurs in the VCF or in the VCA, but for sure itsounds very unpleasant.(2) Make the osc mixers clip earlier than the filter=========================================This is achieved by inserting resistors between the OTA outputsand the filter input current summing node. -> Cut the copper trace from Pin 12/13 of U464 (CA3280) to Pin 1     of U469 (CEM3320). Then close the connection by inserting     a 220k resistor. (best to be done on copper side) -> Do the same thing for voices 2 to 5.(3) Re-wire the 100k resistors for noise=================================After (2), the summing node is not at U464, Pin 12/13 anymore, butthe noise is routed there. To avoid further scatching of copper traces,replace the 100k resistors completely: -> Cut out R4367 (100k), and solder in another 100k resistor that leads to     Pin 1 of U464 directly. (best to be done on copper side). -> Do the same thing for voices 2 to 5.Summary========* You need 12 resistors that should cost you less than 1 dollar.* Your Prophet can sound the same as before if you only use the   first half of the mixer pots' range. (You do *not* loose SNR, because    you have the same if not better signal stength as you had before.)* You can achieve much more "fatness" (or was that "thickness" ??)   than on a unmodified Rev. 3 Prophet.Hope you found this interesting.As usual, I guarantee for nothing, so don't blame me if you fry your synth!JH.
