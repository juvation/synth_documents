<FONT SIZE = 3 ALIGN=CENTER><B>SOUND ON SOUND TECHNICAL GLOSSARY</B></FONT>
<P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL,Helvetica" COLOR="#3116C8">Here is an explanatory
selection of common technical terms 
associated with Recording, MIDI, Audio and Music Technology.
If we do not explain a particular term below, please email 
the missing term to <A HREF="mailto:info@soundonsound.com">info@soundonsound.com</A>
and we will add it to the next update.</FONT></B></P>
<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL,Helvetica" SIZE = 2><B>AC</B>: Alternating Current. <BR>
<B>A/D CONVERTER:</B> Circuit for converting analogue waveforms into a
series of equally spaced numerical values represented by binary numbers.
The more 'bits' a converter has, the greater the resolution of the sampling
process. <BR>
<B>ACTIVE:</B> Describes a circuit containing transistors, ICs, tubes and
other devices, that require power to operate and are capable of amplification.
<BR>
<B>ADDITIVE SYNTHESIS:</B> A system for generating waveforms or sounds
by combining basic waveforms or sampled sounds prior to further processing
with filters and envelope shapers. <BR>
<B>ADSR:</B> Envelope generator with Attack, Sustain, Decay and Release
parameters. This is a simple type of envelope generator and was first used
on early analogue synthesizers. This form of envelope generator continues
to be popular on modern instruments. See <A HREF="#Decay">Decay</A> for
more details. <BR>
<B>ACTIVE SENSING:</B> A system used to verify that a MIDI connection is
working, that involves the sending device sending frequent short messages
to the receiving device to reassure it that all is well. If these active
sensing messages stop for any reason,the receiving device will recognise
a fault condition and switch off all notes. Not all MIDI devices support
active sensing. <BR>
<B>AFL:</B> After Fade listen; a system used within mixing consoles to
allow specific signals to be monitored at the level set by their fader
of level control knob. Aux sends are generally monitored AFL rather than
PFL (see <A HREF="#PFL">PFL</A>). <BR>
<B>AFTERTOUCH:</B> A means of generating a control signal based on how
much pressure is applied to the keys of a MIDI keyboard. Most instruments
that support this do not have independent pressure sensing for all keys,
but rather detect the overall pressure by means of a sensing strip running
beneath the keys. Aftertouch may be used to control such functions as vibrato
depth, filter brightness, loudness and so on. <BR>
<B>ALGORITHM:</B> A computer program designed to perform a specific task.
In the context of effects units, algorithms usually describe a software
building block designed to create a specific effect or combination of effects.
<BR>
<B>ALIASING:</B> When an analogue signal is sampled for conversion into
a digital data stream, the sampling frequency must be at least twice that
of the highest frequency component of the input signal. If this rule is
disobeyed, the sampling process becomes ambiguous as there are insufficient
points to define each cycle of the waveform, resulting in enharmonic frequencies
being added to the audible signal. <BR>
<B>AMBIENCE:</B> The result of sound reflections in a confined space being
added to the original sound. Ambience may also be created electronically
by some digital reverb units. The main difference between ambience and
reverberation is that ambience doesn't have the characteristic long delay
time of reverberation - the reflections mainly give the sound a sense of
space. <BR>
<A NAME="Ampere"></A><B>AMP:</B> (Ampere) Unit of electrical current. <BR>
<B>AMPLIFIER:</B> Device that increases the level of an electrical signal.
<BR>
<B>AMPLITUDE:</B> Another word for level. Can refer to sound levels or
electrical signal levels. <BR>
<B>ANALOGUE:</B> Circuitry that uses a continually changing voltage or
current to represent a signal. The origin of the term is that the electrical
signal can be thought of as being 'analogous' to the original signal. <BR>
<B>ANALOGUE SYNTHESIS:</B> A system for synthesizing sounds by means of
analogue circuitry, usually by filtering simple repeating waveforms. ATTENUATE:
To make lower in level. <BR>
<B>ANTI-ALIASING FILTER:</B> Filter used to limit the frequency range of
an analogue signal prior to A/D conversion so that the maximum frequency
does not exceed half the sampling rate. <BR>
<B>APPLICATION:</B> Alternative term for computer program. <BR>
<B>ARPEGGIATOR:</B> Device (or software), that allows a MIDI instrument
to sequence around any notes currently being played. Most arpeggiators
also allows the sound to be sequenced over several octaves, so that holding
down a simple chord can result in an impressive repeating sequence of notes.
<BR>
<B>ASCII:</B> American Standard Code for Information Interchange. A standard
code for representing computer keyboard characters by binary data. <BR>
<B>ATTACK:</B> The time taken for a sound to achieve maximum amplitude.
Drums have a fast attack, whereas bowed strings have a slow attack. In
compressors and gates, the attack time equates to how quickly the processor
can change its gain. <BR>
<B>AUDIO FREQUENCY:</B> Signals in the human audio range: nominally 20Hz
to 20kHz. <BR>
<B>AUTOLOCATOR:</B> Feature of a tape machine or other recording device
that enables specific locations to be stored, then at some later time,
these locations within the recording may be recalled. For example, you
may store the start of a verse as a locate point so that you can get the
tape machine to wind back the start of the verse after you've recorded
an overdub. <BR>
<B>AUX:</B> Control on a mixing console designed to route a proportion
of the channel signal to the effects or cue mix outputs (Aux Send). <BR>
<B>AUX SEND:</B> Physical output from a mixer Aux Send buss. <BR>
<B>AUX RETURN:</B> Mixer inputs used to add effects to the mix. <BR>
<B>AZIMUTH:</B> Alignment coordinate of a tape head which references the
head gap to the true vertical relative to the tape path. <BR>
<B>BACKUP:</B> A safety copy of software or other digital data. <BR>
<B>BAND PASS FILTER (BPF):</B> Filter that removes or attenuates frequencies
above and below the frequency at which it is set. Frequencies within the
band are emphasised. Bandpass filters are often used in synthesizers as
tone shaping elements. <BR>
<B>BALANCE:</B> This word has several meanings in recording. It may refer
to the relative levels of the left and right channels of a stereo recording,
or it may be used to describe the relative levels of the various instruments
and voices within a mix. <BR>
<B>BALANCED WIRING:</B> Wiring system which uses two out-of-phase conductors
and a common screen to reduce the effect of interference. For balancing
to be effective, both the sending and receiving device must have balanced
output and input stages respectively. <BR>
<B>BANDPASS:</B> A filter that passes frequencies only between specific
upper and lower limits. <BR>
<B>BANDWIDTH:</B> A means of specifying the range of frequencies passed
by an electronic circuit such as an amplifier, mixer or filter. The frequency
range is usually measured at the points where the level drops by 3dB relative
to the maximum. <BR>
<B>BETA VERSION:</B> Software which is not fully tested and may include
bugs. <BR>
<B>BIAS:</B> High frequency signal used in analogue recording to improve
the accuracy of the recorded signal and to drive the erase head. Bias is
generated by a bias oscillator. <BR>
<B>BINARY:</B> Counting system based on only two states - 1s and 0s. <BR>
<B>BIOS:</B> Part of a computer operating system held on ROM rather than
on disk. This handles basic routines such as accessing the disk drive.
<BR>
<B>BIT:</B> Binary digit, which may either be 1 or 0. <BR>
<B>BOOST/CUT CONTROL:</B> A single control which allows the range of frequencies
passing through a filter to be either amplified or attenuated. The centre
position is usually the 'flat' or 'no effect' position. <BR>
<B>BOUNCING:</B> The process of mixing two or more recorded tracks together
and re-recording these onto another track. <BR>
<B>BPM:</B> Beats Per Minute. <BR>
<B>BREATH CONTROLLER:</B> Device that converts breath pressure into MIDI
controller data. <BR>
<B>BUFFER:</B> Circuit designed to isolate the output of a source device
from loading effects due to the input impedance of the destination device.
<BR>
<B>BUFFER MEMORY:</B> Temporary RAM memory used in some computer operations,
sometimes to prevent a break in the data stream when the computer is interrupted
to perform another task. <BR>
<B>BUG:</B> Slang term for software fault or equipment design problem.
<BR>
<B>BUSS:</B> A common electrical signal path along which signals may travel.

the same number. The last SCSI device in the chain should be terminated,
either via an internal terminator, where provided or via a plug-in terminator
fitted to a free SCSI socket. <BR>

<b>S/PDIF</b> -- Acronym for &quot;Sony/Philips Digital Inter Face&quot;. <i>[ Also sometimes referred to by its common &quot;standards&quot; title of IEC958 (type-2). It also conforms with the EIAJ standard of CP-340 (type-2), now renumbered to CP-1201 ]</i>.
<br>The S/PDIF digital data format is very similar to the professional AES-EBU standard although it uses different electrical characteristics. The system normally carries 16 or 20-bit data, although it can accommodate 24-bits of audio data per channel. Extra information can also be carried along side the audio such as track start flags, source identification information, and timing data.
<br>The electrical interface is unbalanced and normally employs phono connectors. The source impedance of 75 Ohms and high signal frequencies (0.1 to 6MHz) require good quality 75-Ohm co-axial (RF) cable to operate reliably. Also, as the source amplitude of the data signal is only 0.5V peak-to-peak this restricts the transmission distance to short cable runs of up to about 10 metres.
<br>An optical version of the interface is also available known as &quot;<b>TOSLink</b>&quot; which transmits the same data signals as the electrical IEC958. This is achieved with an LED transmitter and an opto-sensor as the receiver. High quality optical interfaces offer several advantages in terms of galvanic isolation and freedom from electro-magnetic interference, but cheap fibre-optic cables suffer from restricted bandwidths and high dispersion which result in severe timing instability and data errors.<br>

or electrical wave varies with time. <BR>
<B>WHITE NOISE:</B> A random signal with an energy distribution that produces
the same amount of noise power per Hz. <BR>

The 'metronome' that governs sample timing is called the <I>Word Clock</I> (sometimes conjoined to 'Wordclock', or abbreviated to 'Wclk'). However, word clock does more than merely beat time; it also identifies the start and end of each digital word or sample, and which samples belong to the left or right channels. Digital interfaces such as the AES-EBU and S/PDIF embody clock signals within the data stream, but it is often necessary to convey a discrete word clock between equipment as a square wave signal running at the sampling rate. Dedicated word clock inputs and outputs on digital equipment generally use BNC connectors (the kind of terminals commonly used for video).<br>
