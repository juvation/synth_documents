		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">For the past few months, we've been using synthesizers to imitate a specialised form of electronic keyboard: the string synth or string machine. Designed to generate a sound reminiscent of ensemble strings, and to appeal to players who could not afford a Mellotron, this was the instrument first developed in the 1960s by Ken Freeman and later perfected by Italian organ and accordion manufacturers such as Logan.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Nobody in their right mind would claim that string synths were indistinguishable from the massed strings of a real orchestra, but they proved to be adept at creating the impression of such things and, when played sympathetically, could almost fool you. Given that we used sawtooth waves to generate our ensemble sounds, it would seem reasonable to infer that, if multiple sawtooth waves imitate the sound of multiple string instruments, one sawtooth might imitate the sound of a <i>single</i> string instru<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="2" frame align="right">

Numerous books analyse and explain its shape, its construction, the materials used, the nature of the strings, the effect of the bridge, the bow, the bowing position, the differences introduced by fast and slow bowing, the effects of higher and lower bowing pressures, the effects of vibrato, pizzicato... and many other factors.

Nonetheless, keyboard players were emulating solo violins and their close relatives many years before the advent of digital synthesis, DSPs, and physical modelling, so there must be a way to achieve acceptable results on subtractive synthesizers. So let's start &#151; as we have in the past &#151; by looking at the waveform produced by the excitation mechanism of the instrument; in this case, the string and the bow.</font></p>

		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Because of friction, the bow applies a displacing force to the point of contact on the string, which is stretched progressively into the shape shown in Figure 2 (below). As this happens, the string's tension generates a restoring force that tries to return it to its rest position &#151; ie. a straight line. This force increases as the displacement increases so, at some point, the restoring force exceeds the ability of friction to drag the string further. At this point, the string begins to slip...</font></p>

		</table>ach other, and we call these two types of friction 'dynamic' and 'static' respectively. Think about it: a car parked by static friction on a steep hill will tend to remain stationary, but if it does start to slide, the lesser dynamic friction between it and the road will be insufficient to arrest its motion until the incline flattens out (or something more dramatic occurs on the way down!). Relating this idea to the bowed string, static friction will 'stick' the string to the bow until the returning force causes it to slip. At this point, the interaction between the bow and the string becomes one of dynamic friction, which is the lesser force, so the string will snap back. However, it does so to a point <i>beyond</i> the original rest position because, just like a plucked string, its momentum takes it into the region where its tension slows it to a halt (see Figure 3, below left).</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Once the string has reached a point somewhere beyond its rest position, the dynamic friction is great enough to stick the string to the bow for a second time. At this moment, static friction takes over, and the string is displaced again<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="2" frame align="right">

		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Surprisingly, if the bowing position is in the centre of the string, the speed at which the string 'snaps back' appears to be much the same as that as which it is dragged. We can draw this motion as shown in Figure 4 above: it's a triangle motion, although it's one whose centre is offset from the rest position of the string.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Now, it's tempting to think that because the bowed point describes a triangle wave, the audio waveform generated by the string is also a triangle wave. As I showed when I analysed the plucked string, this is sometimes a reasonable conclusion... but on this occasion, it's wrong.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If you refer back to the part of this series in which I analysed the behaviour of a plucked string (see <i>SOS</i> August 2001, or surf to <a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/aug01/articles/synthsecrets28.asp" target="_blank">www.soundonsound.com/sos/aug01/articles/synthsecrets28.asp</a>), you'll recall that two waves &#151; one travelling left to right, the other right to left &#151; combine to produce the wave motion of a plucked string (see Figure 5 above).</font></p>

		</table>ed string is not the same as a plucked string, and the physics of its vibrations are different, because the string does not oscillate freely. Without going into the maths to prove why this should be so, there appears to be just one wave in the bowed string, and this travels around as shown in Figure 6, right. The speed with which this wave travels, and therefore its frequency, is the same as that of the freely vibrating string, and although this might seem to be a coincidence, it must be so, or it would not be possible to play pizzicato notes on a violin at the same pitch as you obtain when bowing it.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If you study Figure 6 more carefully, you can see that, as the wave travels around the string, the point under the bow describes the triangular motion in Figure 4. This would seem to imply that the bowing speed determines the pitch of the note thus created. But we <i>know</i> that this is wrong; any violin player will tell you that the musical pitch is not determined by the bowing speed. So what changes as you move the bow faster or more slowly? It's the point at which the string snaps back, which<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="2" frame align="right">

		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Now we can consider what happens if the player bows the string in different positions. We already know what happens when it is bowed in the centre: the bowing point moves in a triangle wave, and there are no even harmonics. This is because, as with the plucked string, all the even harmonics would require the centre of the string to be at rest, which is impossible when that is being bowed (if this explanation has lost you, it's explained in much more detail in that August 2001 instalment of this series, the one about the behaviour of the plucked string). It's possible to deduce that if the bow is one third of the distance from the bridge to the nut there can be no third, sixth, ninth, and other 'third' harmonics in the waveform. Similarly, a bowing position a quarter of the way from the bridge eliminates the fourth, eighth, 12th (and so on) harmonics. But if the bowing position is some arbitrary distance from the bridge, it is likely that <i>all</i> the harmonics will be excited to a greater or lesser degree. This proves to be the case, but it still does not tell us what waveform the instrument produces. To determine this, we need to consider something else &#151; the forces acting upon the bridge which separates the strings from the body of the instrument.<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="6" width="35%" align="right">

What's more, in a delicious twist of fate, the static friction of rosin rises as it gets warmer, so that it is more efficient at displacing the string during the dragging period. At the same time, its dynamic friction decreases, so the string snaps back even more smoothly than it otherwise could. Perfect!</font></td>

Firstly, the pitch of the note goes slightly flat as it becomes louder. Secondly, there is jitter in the pitch as the 'corner' of the wave in Figure 6 passes under the bow. If we were being thorough, we would also have to consider the reflection of waves at the point of string/bow contact, and the effect that these have as they bounce around in the two sections of string either side of the bow.

Fortunately for the purposes of this exercise, it is; academics achieve this by suspending the body and then energising it at every frequency using a swept sine-wave oscillator. They then measure the radiated sound. In the case of the violin, the observed result is a curve with a flat response across a few hundred Hertz, a steep roll-off in the bass, and a gentler roll-off of about 9dB per octave in the upper-mid and high frequencies (see Figure 13, above left).</font></p>

		<img height="6" width="6" src="../../regulars/bulbow.gif" align="absmiddle"> Given that the bodies of guitars and bowed instruments are energised by sawtooth waves, it is vital to imitate the 'shape' of the sound generated by the bowing action, and to differentiate it from the shape of a plucked string (there are good reasons why pizzicato played on a violin or viola shares many of the sonic attributes of a banjo!).<br>
		<img height="6" width="6" src="../../regulars/bulbow.gif" align="absmiddle"> Secondly, the shape of the spectrum in Figure 14 is important. The timbre of a violin is strongly linked to the dominant body resonances in the region of a few hundred Hertz, as well as the broad combination of resonances in the region of 2kHz to 4-5kHz or thereabouts. Without these (or their equivalents for the viola or cello) the sound will not be realistic.<br>
