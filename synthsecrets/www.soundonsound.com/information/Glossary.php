The more 'bits' a converter has, the greater the resolution of the sampling process. <br/>	<b>ACTIVE:</b> Describes a circuit containing transistors, ICs, tubes and other devices, that require power to operate and are capable of amplification. <br/>	<b>ADDITIVE SYNTHESIS:</b> A system for generating waveforms or sounds by combining basic waveforms or sampled sounds prior to further processing with filters and envelope shapers. <br/>	<b>ADSR:</b> Envelope generator with Attack, Sustain, Decay and Release parameters. This is a simple type of envelope generator and was first used on early analogue synthesizers. This form of envelope generator continues to be popular on modern instruments. See <a href="#Decay">Decay</a> for more details. <br/>	<b>ACTIVE SENSING:</b> A system used to verify that a MIDI connection is working, that involves the sending device sending frequent short messages to the receiving device to reassure it that all is well. If these active sensing messages stop for any reason,the receiving device will recognise a fault condition and switch off all notes. Not all MIDI devices support active sensing. <br/>	<b>AFL:</b> After Fade listen; a system used within mixing consoles to allow specific signals to be monitored at the level set by their fader of level control knob. Aux sends are generally monitored AFL rather than PFL (see <a href="#PFL">PFL</a>). <br/>	<b>AFTERTOUCH:</b> A means of generating a control signal based on how much pressure is applied to the keys of a MIDI keyboard. Most instruments that support this do not have independent pressure sensing for all keys, but rather detect the overall pressure by means of a sensing strip running beneath the keys. Aftertouch may be used to control such functions as vibrato depth, filter brightness, loudness and so on. <br/>	<b>ALGORITHM:</b> A computer program designed to perform a specific task. In the context of effects units, algorithms usually describe a software building block designed to create a specific effect or combination of effects. <br/>	<b>ALIASING:</b> When an analogue signal is sampled for conversion into a digital data stream, the sampling frequency must be at least twice that of the highest frequency component of the input signal. If this rule is disobeyed, the sampling process becomes ambiguous as there are insufficient points to define each cycle of the waveform, resulting in enharmonic frequencies being added to the audible signal. <br/>	<b>AMBIENCE:</b> The result of sound reflections in a confined space being added to the original sound. Ambience may also be created electronically by some digital reverb units. The main difference between ambience and reverberation is that ambience doesn't have the characteristic long delay time of reverberation - the reflections mainly give the sound a sense of space. <br/>	<a name="Ampere"></a><b>AMP:</b> (Ampere) Unit of electrical current. <br/>	<b>AMPLIFIER:</b> Device that increases the level of an electrical signal. <br/>	<b>AMPLITUDE:</b> Another word for level. Can refer to sound levels or electrical signal levels. <br/>	<b>ANALOGUE:</b> Circuitry that uses a continually changing voltage or current to represent a signal. The origin of the term is that the electrical signal can be thought of as being 'analogous' to the original signal. <br/>	<b>ANALOGUE SYNTHESIS:</b> A system for synthesizing sounds by means of analogue circuitry, usually by filtering simple repeating waveforms. ATTENUATE: To make lower in level. <br/>	<b>ANTI-ALIASING FILTER:</b> Filter used to limit the frequency range of an analogue signal prior to A/D conversion so that the maximum frequency does not exceed half the sampling rate. <br/>	<b>APPLICATION:</b> Alternative term for computer program. <br/>	<b>ARPEGGIATOR:</b> Device (or software), that allows a MIDI instrument to sequence around any notes currently being played. Most arpeggiators also allows the sound to be sequenced over several octaves, so that holding down a simple chord can result in an impressive repeating sequence of notes. <br/>	<b>ASCII:</b> American Standard Code for Information Interchange. A standard code for representing computer keyboard characters by binary data. <br/>	<b>ATTACK:</b> The time taken for a sound to achieve maximum amplitude. Drums have a fast attack, whereas bowed strings have a slow attack. In compressors and gates, the attack time equates to how quickly the processor can change its gain. <br/>	<b>AUDIO FREQUENCY:</b> Signals in the human audio range:nominally 20Hz to 20kHz. <br/>	<b>AUTOLOCATOR:</b> Feature of a tape machine or other recording device that enables specific locations to be stored, then at some later time, these locations within the recording may be recalled. For example, you may store the start of a verse as a locate point so that you can get the tape machine to wind back the start of the verse after you've recorded an overdub. <br/>	<b>AUX:</b> Control on a mixing console designed to route a proportion of the channel signal to the effects or cue mix outputs (Aux Send). <br/>	<b>AUX SEND:</b> Physical output from a mixer Aux Send buss. <br/>	<b>AUX RETURN:</b> Mixer inputs used to add effects to the mix. <br/>	<b>AZIMUTH:</b> Alignment coordinate of a tape head which references the head gap to the true vertical relative to the tape path. <br/>	<br/>	<div style="padding: 3px"><span class="AZ"><a name="B"></a>B</span> <a href="#A">A</a> <a href="#B">B</a> <a href="#C">C</a> <a href="#D">D</a> <a href="#E">E</a> <a href="#F">F</a> <a href="#G">G</a> <a href="#H">H</a> <a href="#I">I</a> <a href="#J">J</a> <a href="#K">K</a> <a href="#L">L</a> <a href="#M">M</a> <a href="#N">N</a> <a href="#O">O</a> <a href="#P">P</a> <a href="#Q">Q</a> <a href="#R">R</a> <a href="#S">S</a> <a href="#T">T</a> <a href="#U">U</a> <a href="#V">V</a> <a href="#W">W</a> <a href="#X">X</a> <a href="#Y">Y</a> <a href="#Z">Z</a></div><br/>	<b>BACKUP:</b> A safety copy of software or other digital data. <br/>	<b>BAND PASS FILTER (BPF):</b> Filter that removes or attenuates frequencies above and below the frequency at which it is set. Frequencies within the band are emphasised. Bandpass filters are often used in synthesizers as tone shaping elements. <br/>	<b>BALANCE:</b> This word has several meanings in recording. It may refer to the relative levels of the left and right channels of a stereo recording, or it may be used to describe the relative levels of the various instruments and voices within a mix. <br/>	<b>BALANCED WIRING:</b> Wiring system which uses two out-of-phase conductors and a common screen to reduce the effect of interference. For balancing to be effective, both the sending and receiving device must have balanced output and input stages respectively. <br/>	<b>BANDPASS:</b> A filter that passes frequencies only between specific upper and lower limits. <br/>	<b>BANDWIDTH:</b> A means of specifying the range of frequencies passed by an electronic circuit such as an amplifier, mixer or filter. The frequency range is usually measured at the points where the level drops by 3dB relative to the maximum. <br/>	<b>BETA VERSION:</b> Software which is not fully tested and may include bugs. <br/>	<b>BIAS:</b> High frequency signal used in analogue recording to improve the accuracy of the recorded signal and to drive the erase head. Bias is generated by a bias oscillator. <br/>	<b>BINARY:</b> Counting system based on only two states - 1s and 0s. <br/>	<b>BIOS:</b> Part of a computer operating system held on ROM rather than on disk. This handles basic routines such as accessing the disk drive. <br/>	<b>BIT:</b> Binary digit, which may either be 1 or 0. <br/>	<b>BOOST/CUT CONTROL:</b> A single control which allows the range of frequencies passing through a filter to be either amplified or attenuated. The centre position is usually the 'flat' or 'no effect' position. <br/>	<b>BOUNCING:</b> The process of mixing two or more recorded tracks together and re-recording these onto another track. <br/>	<b>BPM:</b> Beats Per Minute. <br/>	<b>BREATH CONTROLLER:</b> Device that converts breath pressure into MIDI controller data. <br/>	<b>BUFFER:</b> Circuit designed to isolate the output of a source device from loading effects due to the input impedance of the destination device. <br/>	<b>BUFFER MEMORY:</b> Temporary RAM memory used in some computer operations, sometimes to prevent a break in the data stream when the computer is interrupted to perform another task. <br/>	<b>BUG:</b> Slang term for software fault or equipment design problem. <br/>	<b>BUSS:</b> A common electrical signal path along which signals may travel. In a mixer, there are several busses carrying the stereo mix, the groups, the PFL signal, the aux sends and so on. Power supplies are also fed along busses. <br/>	<b>BYTE:</b> A piece of digital data comprising eight bits. <br/>	<br/>	<div style="padding: 3px"><span class="AZ"><a name="C"></a>C</span> <a href="#A">A</a> <a href="#B">B</a> <a href="#C">C</a> <a href="#D">D</a> <a href="#E">E</a> <a href="#F">F</a> <a href="#G">G</a> <a href="#H">H</a> <a href="#I">I</a> <a href="#J">J</a> <a href="#K">K</a> <a href="#L">L</a> <a href="#M">M</a> <a href="#N">N</a> <a href="#O">O</a> <a href="#P">P</a> <a href="#Q">Q</a> <a href="#R">R</a> <a href="#S">S</a> <a href="#T">T</a> <a href="#U">U</a> <a href="#V">V</a> <a href="#W">W</a> <a href="#X">X</a> <a href="#Y">Y</a> <a href="#Z">Z</a></div><br/>	<b>CARDIOID:</b> Meaning heart shaped, describes the polar response of a unidirectional microphone. <br/>	<b>CD-R:</b> A recordable type of Compact Disc that can only be recorded once - it cannot be erased and reused. <br/>	<b>CD-R BURNER:</b> A device capable of recording data onto blank CD-R discs. <br/>	<b>CV:</b> Control Voltage used to control the pitch of an oscillator or filter frequency in an analogue synthesizer. Most analogue synthesizers follow a one volt per octave convention, though there are exceptions.

The best known application of Ring Modulation is the creation of Dalek voices but it may also be used to create dramatic instrumental textures. Depending on the relationships between the input signals, the results may either be musical or extremely dissonant - for example, ring modulation can be used to create bell-like tones.

It also conforms with the EIAJ standard of CP-340 (type-2), now renumbered to CP-1201 ]</i>. <br/>	The S/PDIF digital data format is very similar to the professional AES-EBU standard although it uses different electrical characteristics. The system normally carries 16 or 20-bit data, although it can accommodate 24-bits of audio data per channel. Extra information can also be carried along side the audio such as track start flags, source identification information, and timing data. <br/>	The electrical interface is unbalanced and normally employs phono connectors. The source impedance of 75 Ohms and high signal frequencies (0.1 to 6MHz) require good quality 75-Ohm co-axial (RF) cable to operate reliably. Also, as the source amplitude of the data signal is only 0.5V peak-to-peak this restricts the transmission distance to short cable runs of up to about 10 metres. <br/>	An optical version of the interface is also available known as &quot;<b>TOSLink</b>&quot; which transmits the same data signals as the electrical IEC958. This is achieved with an LED transmitter and an opto-sensor as the receiver. High quality optical interfaces offer several advantages in terms of galvanic isolation and freedom from electro-magnetic interference, but cheap fibre-optic cables suffer from restricted bandwidths and high dispersion which result in severe timing instability and data errors.<br/>	 <b>SPL:</b> Sound Pressure Level measured in dBs. <br/>	<b>SPP:</b> Song Position Pointer (MIDI). <br/>	<b>STANDARD MIDI FILE:</b> A standard file format that allows MIDI files to be transferred between different sequencers and MIDI file players. <br/>	<b>STEP TIME:</b> A system for programming a sequencer in non-real time. <br/>	<b>STEREO:</b> two-channel system feeding left and right loudspeakers. <br/>	<b>STICKY SHED SYNDROME:</b> A problem affecting some brands of analogue tape after a long time in storage.

Popular on modern PCs and associated computer peripherals (printers, scanners etc) but also adopted by Apple on their iMac and blue G3 machines onwards.<br/>	<br/>	<div style="padding: 3px"><span class="AZ"><a name="V"></a>V</span> <a href="#A">A</a> <a href="#B">B</a> <a href="#C">C</a> <a href="#D">D</a> <a href="#E">E</a> <a href="#F">F</a> <a href="#G">G</a> <a href="#H">H</a> <a href="#I">I</a> <a href="#J">J</a> <a href="#K">K</a> <a href="#L">L</a> <a href="#M">M</a> <a href="#N">N</a> <a href="#O">O</a> <a href="#P">P</a> <a href="#Q">Q</a> <a href="#R">R</a> <a href="#S">S</a> <a href="#T">T</a> <a href="#U">U</a> <a href="#V">V</a> <a href="#W">W</a> <a href="#X">X</a> <a href="#Y">Y</a> <a href="#Z">Z</a></div><br/>	 <b>VALVE:</b> Vacuum tube amplification component, also known as a tube. <br/>	<b>VELOCITY:</b> The rate at which a key is depressed. This may be used to control loudness (to simulate the response of instruments such as pianos) or other parameters on later synthesizers. <br/>	<b>VOCODER:</b> Signal processor that imposes a changing spectral filter on a sound based on the frequency characteristics of a second sound. By taking the spectral content of a human voice and imposing it on a musical instrument, talking instrument effects can be created. <br/>	<b>VOICE:</b> The capacity of a synthesizer to play a single musical note. An instrument capable of playing 16 simultaneous notes is said to be a 16-voice instrument. <br/>	<b>VIBRATO:</b> Pitch modulation using an <a href="#LFO">LFO</a> to modulate a VCO. <br/>	<b>VU Meter:</b> Meter designed to interpret signal levels in roughly the same way as the human ear, which responds more closely to the average levels of sounds rather than to the peak levels. <br/>	<br/>	<div style="padding: 3px"><span class="AZ"><a name="W"></a>W</span> <a href="#A">A</a> <a href="#B">B</a> <a href="#C">C</a> <a href="#D">D</a> <a href="#E">E</a> <a href="#F">F</a> <a href="#G">G</a> <a href="#H">H</a> <a href="#I">I</a> <a href="#J">J</a> <a href="#K">K</a> <a href="#L">L</a> <a href="#M">M</a> <a href="#N">N</a> <a href="#O">O</a> <a href="#P">P</a> <a href="#Q">Q</a> <a href="#R">R</a> <a href="#S">S</a> <a href="#T">T</a> <a href="#U">U</a> <a href="#V">V</a> <a href="#W">W</a> <a href="#X">X</a> <a href="#Y">Y</a> <a href="#Z">Z</a></div><br/>	 <b>WAH PEDAL:</b> Guitar effects device where a bandpass filter is varied in frequency by means of a pedal control. <br/>	<b>WATT:</b> Unit of electrical power. <br/>	<b>WARMTH:</b> Subjective term used to describe sound where the bass and low mid frequencies have depth and where the high frequencies are smooth sounding rather than being aggressive or fatiguing. Warm sounding tube equipment may also exhibit some of the aspects of compression. <br/>	<b>WAVEFORM:</b> A graphic representation of the way in which a sound wave or electrical wave varies with time. <br/>	<b>WHITE NOISE:</b> A random signal with an energy distribution that produces the same amount of noise power per Hz. <br/>	<b>WORD CLOCK:</b> The precise and accurate timing of digital audio samples is critical to the correct operation of interconnected digital audio equipment. The 'metronome' that governs sample timing is called the <i>Word Clock</i> (sometimes conjoined to 'Wordclock', or abbreviated to 'Wclk'). However, word clock does more than merely beat time; it also identifies the start and end of each digital word or sample, and which samples belong to the left or right channels. Digital interfaces such as the AES-EBU and S/PDIF embody clock signals within the data stream, but it is often necessary to convey a discrete word clock between equipment as a square wave signal running at the sampling rate. Dedicated word clock inputs and outputs on digital equipment generally use BNC connectors (the kind of terminals commonly used for video).<br/>	 <b>WRITE:</b> To save data to a digital storage medium, such as a hard drive. <br/>	<br/>	<div style="padding: 3px"><span class="AZ"><a name="X"></a>X</span> <a href="#A">A</a> <a href="#B">B</a> <a href="#C">C</a> <a href="#D">D</a> <a href="#E">E</a> <a href="#F">F</a> <a href="#G">G</a> <a href="#H">H</a> <a href="#I">I</a> <a href="#J">J</a> <a href="#K">K</a> <a href="#L">L</a> <a href="#M">M</a> <a href="#N">N</a> <a href="#O">O</a> <a href="#P">P</a> <a href="#Q">Q</a> <a href="#R">R</a> <a href="#S">S</a> <a href="#T">T</a> <a href="#U">U</a> <a href="#V">V</a> <a href="#W">W</a> <a href="#X">X</a> <a href="#Y">Y</a> <a href="#Z">Z</a></div><br/>	 <b>XG:</b> Yamaha's alternative to Roland's GS system for enhancing the General MIDI protocol so as to provide additional banks of patches and further editing facilities. <br/>	<b>XLR:</b> Type of connector commonly used to carry balanced audio signals including the feeds from microphones. <br/>	<br/>	<div style="padding: 3px"><span class="AZ"><a name="Y"></a>Y</span> <a href="#A">A</a> <a href="#B">B</a> <a href="#C">C</a> <a href="#D">D</a> <a href="#E">E</a> <a href="#F">F</a> <a href="#G">G</a> <a href="#H">H</a> <a href="#I">I</a> <a href="#J">J</a> <a href="#K">K</a> <a href="#L">L</a> <a href="#M">M</a> <a href="#N">N</a> <a href="#O">O</a> <a href="#P">P</a> <a href="#Q">Q</a> <a href="#R">R</a> <a href="#S">S</a> <a href="#T">T</a> <a href="#U">U</a> <a href="#V">V</a> <a href="#W">W</a> <a href="#X">X</a> <a href="#Y">Y</a> <a href="#Z">Z</a></div><br/>	 <b>Y-Lead:</b> Lead split so that one source can feed two destinations.
